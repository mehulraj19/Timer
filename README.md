# Timer
Time Web Application using React JS
I have started learning React JS and I have cam across a very cool feature of this framework: "useState()". Baiscally this helps to hook to the values and help us to change 
what we see in UI.
<br/>
<h3>UI = f(state)</h3>
"useState" function helps us to hook to this state and make changes accordingly.

useState has 2 parameters:
1. Start point
2. Function that it needs to perform (This is the function that we going to use to make changes that we want.)
